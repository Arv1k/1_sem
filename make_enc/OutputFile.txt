If you can keep your head when all about you
If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
But make allowance for their doubting too;
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,




If you can keep your head when all about you
If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
But make allowance for their doubting too;
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,




And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
If you can keep your head when all about you
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
